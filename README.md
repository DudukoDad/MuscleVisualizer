# Muscle Visualizer
## Requirements 
### Summary
This is an application that allows viewers to assemble workouts and visually see what muscles are worked  

### Purpose
I have found that often times when planning a workout routine, I find it difficult to confirm that I am hitting all of the intended muscles groups

groups worked.
